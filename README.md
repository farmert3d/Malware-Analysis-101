---Why do you need malware analysis?---

Well for starters, sandboxes won't always work.  Sometimes the binaries aren't built for the architecture in your VM.  Sometimes the malware will have anti-sandbox techniques.  Sometimes you just need a little bit more, or more refined, information from a malware sample.  
We also can't forget about the importance of time when dealing with campaigns.  You might not have time to send this sample to another team or vendors to help determine what domains/hashes/system calls you need to block or be on the lookout for.  These skills give you the ability to rapidly churn out IOCs to stop the campaigns in their tracks.
We can't be reliant on other people's intel.  It's great to ingest as many high-fidelity IOCs as possible, but we need to be curating our defense for our organization.  Meaning, we need to find new IOCs that are targeting us.  We aren't always going to be attacked by threat actors targeting loads of other companies.  We will occasionally be the only target that the actor is interested in.  And in those cases, we need to be able to create our own intel.  
Last, and still on an intel note, we need to be threat hunting off of generally unknown techniques that vendors aren't looking out for.  If there is a public IOC or a really popular technique, either our vendor solutions should be looking for it or we should have it automated.  We want to spend our time on things that can't be or are very difficult to automate.  Analysing our own malware lets us see common techniques and spycraft that we can pivot and search off of.  



---Introduction/Preparation---

FLARE (Windows) and Remnux(Ubuntu) are free and great wasy to get started.  Flare does require a valid Windows 7 license..  VirtualBox is a free and popular choice for virtualization solutions.  If you decide to use VMWare you will need Workstation Pro for snapshot support.

Make sure you take a snapshot after running the machine and shutting it down properly the first time.  This will be your clean slate to revert to after every analysis.

Sandboxes are fantastic tools to automate a lot of these processes/tasks, but sandboxes do not always execute correctly.  Malware also often has sandbox evasion which is where these skills really shine.

•	ANY.RUN

•	joesandbox.com

•	Cuckoo (would need to build yourself.  Little difficult if you are new to Linux and malware analysis) - You'll see this referenced in several videos.  Most of these results can be accomplished in other sandboxes.  

Other tools such as decoders/encoders like CyberChef will be very helpful.

Tools such as TIO allow you to run code in any language through your web browser in a VM that TIO hosts to see what it would resolve.

You certainly don't need to go through all of the videos below or learn all of the tools.  They'll be a lot of redundency in what tools do and several ways to find the same information.  Find what works for your workflow.  If you can't get the information you need with the tool you are comfortable with then you might want to explore alternatives to see if you get different results.

---Extras---

If you decide this is extremely interesting, reverse engineering might be your next step.  Malware unicorn is hands down one of the best resources in this space. 

https://malwareunicorn.org/#/workshops

Following that "Practical Malware Analysis" is a popular book but starting to get dated.  I've also heard that Binary Analysis published by No Starch Press is a great "modern" resource.



Happy Hunting!
